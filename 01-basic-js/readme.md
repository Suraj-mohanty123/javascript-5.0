 VARIABLE :-
 Variable is a container to store some data.
 - IN javascript we have 3 types of variables
 1. let:-
     - Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
     - Now these days , most of the case we used to let for creating variable.
     - Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.
 2. var:-
     - Var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
     - Var is used in oldest broswer so now a days we are dont use var most of the time. 
 3. const:-
     - const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
     - const means constant to store some data like numbers, integer etc..
